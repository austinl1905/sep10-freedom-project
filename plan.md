These are just the wireframes for the MVP. The final website could end up looking vastly different.

### MVP

- Simple cards for current and future innovations (boring grid style)
- Working & responsive nav using bootstrap
- Typography
- Colors
- Desktop responsiveness
- Mobile responsiveness
- boring generic bootstrap components


### Beyond MVP (the cool stuff)

- Card timeline thingy that uses keyframes and maybe JS to fade in on scroll
- Cool hero (Done!!!!)
- maybe hide a cat picture here and there
- maybe my own components

## Timeline

4.4 - Finish header and footer

4.5 - scss partials for variables (colors, fonts, pixel values etc)

4.6 - nav and cards, clean up code

4.8 - card for future innovation

4.8 - mobile responsiveness (I kind of do this along the way though)

4.9 - beyond mvp maybe? (I can totally get all of this done in less than a month)
